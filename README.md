cd U.P.A.A
```

## Features
- Responsive image carousel
- Interactive maps of the ponds
- Events section with a detailed calendar

 ## Choice of Bootstrap Integration

I have opted for the local integration of Bootstrap files rather than using a CDN for several key reasons:

- *Version Control*
- *Offline Availability*
- *Performance*
- *Security*
- *Customization*

This approach aligns the development of our site with best practices for increased stability and flexibility, while preparing us for smooth and controlled deployment.

## Usage
Navigate through the different sections of the site to discover our activities, fishing spots, rates, and the events we organize. The site is built with a mobile-first approach to ensure an optimal user experience on all devices.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5 for the base structure
- CSS3 for styling and animations
- Bootstrap 5.2.3 for responsive design and components
